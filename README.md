Find Missing People is a web application that helps simplify the issue of locating missing people, You can file complaints for missing people or if you found someone in stray conditions or if someone got lost from their loved ones. The application uses face recognization to match profiles for the Missing people and Found people and notifies both users whenever there is a match. Example - User A lodged a complaint about a missing person, and another User B founds a person and files a request,
 then if there is a match found then, both of them would be notified.

> #### List of Features it currently Supports includes : 

* Matching Missing Person Profile To Found Person Profile via Face Recognization Azure Api 
* Email Notificaton when got a match 
*  Async Task scheduling via Celery on Backend Server For Better Performance and Less Waiting Time
*  Fuzzy Search For Searching in List of Profiles for Better Filtering 
* ðŸ‘¤ User Authenticaion 
* Authentication also Supports Google Login

Deployed Website :( https://629392f60b696659d6578353--missingpeople.netlify.app)
* Frontend Server is Deployed to Netlify
* Backend Server is Deployed to Heroku (https://proper-backend1.herokuapp.com)
* PostGres Database on Heroku
* Celery On Heroku
* Media Files On cloudinary (https://cloudinary.com/)
* short video demostration to install this project on local setup https://drive.google.com/file/d/15bpbQhZyF_zKradEX_FgcIYMUFXR5KAA/view?usp=sharing

> ## Local Setup 
> *                 First Setup Backend such that when you start frontend it give full functionality.
* For Running this application with full funtionality On your Local Pc You to setup both backend-server(https://github.com/codelover4655/eng_backend)
   and frontend-server(https://github.com/codelover4655/eng_frontend)
 *                                         STEPS TO SETUP FRONTEND SERVER
Pre-Requisites: You must have Nodejs installed locally on your system
* Clone the Repository `git clone https://github.com/codelover4655/eng_frontend.git` or directly download the zip file.
* Move to the directry where this cloned file exist(if cloned in C folder directly so run commed in cmd `cd eng_frontend`)
* Install the Dependencies `npm install`
* Starting the App `npm start` or `node server.js`
* Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the App
* be ensure this port is free for host

                                                STEPS TO SETUP BACKEND SERVER
  
* Clone the Repository `https://github.com/codelover4655/eng_backend.git` or directly download the zip file.
* install python on your pc if not present previously                                            
* Install virtual enviourment for python as there may be some dependencies which OS not give access to install on system directly
* Process to install and create virtual envirment varies for diffrent operterating systems (supporting docs-https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)      
* after activating virtual environment (if required)
* Move to directry where you cloned backend files. root directory of app  (`cd eng_backend`if cloned directly in C folder)
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for installing all the dependencies
* after installing dependencies Run `python manage.py runserver 8000`
* Port must be 8000 because in frontend side it is linked with port 8000 
* Now Django server is running on local server 
* Now Run Celery Server which support Async Request Handling to Run celery Server
* First install rabbitmq on your pc which servers as broker for celery(https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
* Run `celery -A eng_backend worker --pool=solo -l info` From the root directory of App 
* After Both Servers Started running Backend starts giving Response to all Api Request.                                        
> ## Improvements

* The Project has various rooms for improvements from scaling Application to adding new Features like As of Now i reduced the waiting time of user by 
using Async Task sechdulding like When User Files a missing complian i Run a Async task in backend to Search Whole database Foe similer Faces and 
send a Email notification when Found a match by this user may not have to wait for conformation but searching whole database is a time consuming task 
so This is a site of imporvement in my project.
